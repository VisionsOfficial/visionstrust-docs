> Throughout this guide, keep in mind that you can access the [glossary](./glossary.md) at any time if you are unsure of a dataspace related term.

The first step to being able to represent your organisation in the dataspace is by becoming a **Participant** of said dataspace.

VisionsTrust enables you to onboard your organization as a **dataspace participant** through signing up on the VisionsTrust catalogue.

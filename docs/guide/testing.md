# Testing

We're working on tools to enable you to test your configuration and data exchange with an internal VisionsTrust service that simulates a dataspace connector.

This will avoid you having to find other partners in order to test that your configuration is running fine.

The release of this feature is planned for early September 2024 and will be documented on this page when ready.

# Welcome to VisionsTrust Documentation

This site references everything you need to know about the usage of VisionsTrust's application and APIs.

## What is VisionsTrust ?

VisionsTrust is a product that implements multiple **Prometheus-X Building Blocks** in order to provide a centralized marketplace and data exchange infrastructure.

VisionsTrust is a SaaS comprised of **3 services** :

- **A catalogue**: A UI which enables participant onboarding, asset and project discoveries through a centralized marketplace and configuration dashboards for use case orchestrators.
- **A contract management service**: An API plugged into the catalogue UI to enable contract negotiation and signature.
- **A consent management service**: An API accessible by the participants and their [Dataspace Connectors](https://github.com/Prometheus-X-association/dataspace-connector) to handle consent records and trigger data exchanges based on individuals' consents.

This documentation covers guides for technical **and** non-technical actions that can be taken on the **catalogue** as well as technical configuration steps for developers in order to get a data exchange going.

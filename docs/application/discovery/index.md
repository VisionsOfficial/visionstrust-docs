# Browsing the Catalogue

The catalogue is the application's main feature. This is where you will be able to find the different organisations that are also registered on the ecosystem, the data & services they might offer & the different projects that could be interesting for you.

## Overview

When arriving on the catalogue, you will be shown a view where you can browse on some features offers, projects and some of the organisations available.

### Tabs

Different tabs are available for you to check out and filter the catalogue for your needs.

The first tab will display some featured offers, projects and organizations to have a snippet view of everything available on the catalogue. Each card has a Discover button which will open a side drawer with extra information about the product or organization in question.

With the side-drawer opened, you are also able to view the full detailed page of that specific product by clicking on the expand icon at the top of the drawer.

If you want to easily view more offers, or more projects, the dedicated tabs will offer you a view tailored for this specific resource in the catalogue.

No matter what tab you select, the discover, side-drawer and full page details expansion works the same way.

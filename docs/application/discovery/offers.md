# Offers discovery

On the catalogue, clicking on the "Offers" tab will display a dedicated view for all offers available on the catalogue, may they be offers of data or offers of services.

## Offer cards

The cards displayed here work exactly the same way as for the main catalogue tab. Clicking on the discover button will open the side drawer in which there will be some extended information on the offer and access to additionnal actions, such as getting a full page detail of that specific offer and its provider.

## Browsing

This view works with an infinite scroll loading mechanism, so if you don't know what you're looking for, start scrolling ! You should eventually fall on an offer that is of interest for you.

## Filtering

If you already know what kind of offers you're looking for, the Filter options are here for you, they are the same as on the main catalogue but will only show results found in offers.

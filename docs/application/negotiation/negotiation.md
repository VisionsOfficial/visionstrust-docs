# Negotiation Process

The negotiation process is the flow enabling providers & project orchestrators to negotiate on the usage of the provider's offerings in the project until they reach to an agreement.

After reaching an agreement the provider will be added to the project as well as his offers and their configuration as defined within the negotiation process.

## Negotiation actions

When receiving a notification that a negotiation is available it can mean a couple of things

- **The orchestrator has invited a provider to join a project**: The offerings of the provider have been requested to be used inside of a project, the provider receives the negotiation request and can review it, decide to either accept it or make a counter proposal.
- **The provider has made a counter offer to an initial invitation**: After reviewing the terms and conditions of the usage of his offers in the project, the provider made a counter offer and re-negotiated, it is now to the orchestrator to review it and either accept or make a new proposition on top of it.
- **The orchestrator has made a counter offer to the provider's offer**: After reviewing the terms & conditions of the usage of the provider's offers in the project, the orchestrator made an additional counter offer an re-negotiated. It is once again up to the provider to review it and decide what to do.

This can go on a loop until both the provider and orchestrator agree to an arrangement.

> Note: It is possible for a negotiation to take place again, after the participant has been added to the project members in order to **renegotiate** on the usage of his offerings, which will require a new contract signature.

## Reviewing a negotiation

When reviewing a negotiation, there are a couple of actions that can be done.

### Accepting the negotiation offer

The simplest action that can be done on either the provider's or the orchestrator's side is to accept the negotiation offer. This means that the negotiation offer suits both participants and the provider will be added to the project alongside his offers and the configurations made on top of them during the negotiation process.

### Changing the negotiation values

If the goal is to make a counter offer, the current negotiator is able to adjust the values set in the negotiation for which offerings should be used, the policies and their configuration & the pricing options. If a modification is made, then the negotiator **will not** be able to accept the negotiation and **must** send a re-negotiation offer.

## Results of a successful negotiation

When the provider and the orchestrator end up on an agreement that suits them both and the negotiation is accepted, the following should happen

- **Addition of the provider in the project**: The provider will be added to the list of participants in the project. His pending invitation or join request (depending on where it started) will be authorized and all of his offers that were negotiated will become available to the project as soon as the provider signs the project contract.
- **Signing the contract**: To finalize the provider's participation in the project and for his negotiated offerings to be available to others AND for the offerings of the other members to be available to the provider, the provider **must** sign the project contract.

Signing the project contract puts an end to the negotiation process.

# Project Negotiation

Negotiation is a big part of putting participants in relation with each other in order for them to join projects and settle on how their offers will be used within these projects.

Project negotiation is a required step in order to get an Ecosystem Contract done which will then enable data exchanges between participants of that contract.

> Without a project contract, the data exchange protocol will not be enforceable and no data exchanges will be able to run within the context of the project.
